1. What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?
   -> 1] A protocol stack is a set of protocol layers that all work together to allow communication between client and server.
   2] Diffrent protocol layers - [a] Application layer
   [b] Transport layer
   [c] Network layer
   [d] Link layer
   3] In web development when a client makes a request to server it uses the DNS protocol in application layer to get the IP address of the sever. Then it uses the TCP or UDP of transport layer to establish the connection and then uses HTTP or HTTPS of application layer to send request to the sever.After the server recieves the request it sends back the HTTPS or HTTP respose back.

2. What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?
   -> Different types of web servers are -
   [a] Apache HTTP server: It was developed by Apache Software Foundation. It is an open-source software which means we can access it's code and make changes to it and mold it according to our requirements. It is supported by all operating systems like Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc.
   [b] Microsoft Internet Information Services: It is developed by Microsoft. It is not an open-source software like Apache HTTP server which means we can not make changes to it's code according to our requirements. It can we used on all windows devices.
   [c] Lighttpd: It requires less memory as compared to other servers. We can optimize it's speed according to our requirements.It is also an open source.
   [d] Jigsaw: Jigsaw has been written in the Java language and it can run CGI (common gateway interference) scripts as well as PHP programs. It is also an open source and it can be installed on devices with java support.
   [e] Sun Java System: The Sun Java System supports various languages, scripts, and technologies required for Web 2.0 such as Python, PHP, etc. It is not an open-source software.

   [5] Dedicated server: A Dedicated Server is a physical server where all the resources of one machine are dedicated to a single user. Example, Bluehost.

4. What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?
   -> 1] Scaling means adjusting the computing power of servers to handle more number of users.
   2] Horizontal scaling mean adding new computing nodes or machines to enhance the data processing and storage capabilities whereas in vertical scaling we enhance the existinginfrastructure by adding or replacing CPU, HDD, or other components.
   3] If we want less downtime then we can use horizontal scaling, it is quicker and easier than vertical scaling.But vertical scaling is cheaper than horizontal scaling.

5. What is SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and how can web developers optimize their websites for better search engine rankings?
